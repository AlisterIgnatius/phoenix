## Works for me

![This is fine][itsfine]

Code labeled with this badge is prototype in nature.  It exists to
establish the validity of a concept, and nothing more.  Error handling
may be scant and/or produce unhelpful output, and there are likely no
tests.  Expect every interface to be broken on the very next commit.

Be afraid.  Be very afraid.
