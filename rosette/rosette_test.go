			<h2>Banana plant</h2>
			<p>The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. Banana plants are often mistaken
			for trees. Bananas have a false stem (called pseudostem), which is made by the lower part of the
			leaves. This pseudostem can grow to be two to eight meters tall. Each pseudostem grows from a
			corm. A pseudostem is able to produce a single bunch of bananas. After fruiting, the pseudostem
			dies and is replaced. When most bananas are ripe, they turn yellow or, sometimes, red. Unripe
			bananas are green.</p>

			<p>Banana leaves grow in a spiral and may grow 2.7 metres (8.9 feet) long and 60 cm (2.0 ft)
			wide. They are easily torn by the wind, which results in a familiar, frayed look.</p>
